This project is set up as personal website for Nardo Kraaijeveld. It serves as a sort of online curriculum vitae.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API

Currently there are no API routes added tot the project.
But the [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be added to the `./src/pages/api/` folder and accessed via" http://localhost:5050/api/..".

The `./src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

For performing a check you run the following command.

```bash
npm run type-check
# or
yarn type-check
```

## ESLint

Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```
